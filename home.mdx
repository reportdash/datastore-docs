## What is ReportDash DataStore?

ReportDash DataStore is a pre-fetched analytics data warehouse built for marketing teams and agencies.

Instead of querying ad platforms in real time, DataStore loads, stores, and refreshes historical marketing data in advance—so dashboards stay fast, reliable, and scalable.

### Why DataStore exists

Most marketing tools fetch data live from APIs. This causes slow dashboards, rate-limit issues, and repeated re-fetching of the same data.

DataStore solves this by preloading data once and refreshing it incrementally.

### What DataStore does

- Connects to marketing platforms
- Loads months or years of historical data
- Refreshes new data on a schedule
- Stores data in structured tables
- Exports data to BI tools

### Key concepts

**Sources** – Connected platform accounts\
**Tables** – Campaign, ad, and metric datasets\
**Versions** – Schema-safe table versions\
**Data Views** – Custom joins and transformations

### Where the data goes

- BigQuery
- Looker Studio
- Google Sheets

Dashboards query warehouse data directly—not APIs.

### Who DataStore is for

- Digital marketing agencies
- Growth teams

- Analytics teams supporting marketing
