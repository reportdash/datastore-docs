title: "Query Credits"
---

Each query credit represents one operation that reads or exports up to 10 MB of data. With 25K query credits, you can read or export up to 250 GB of data in total. The usage resets monthly, and every plan includes a set number of query credits. Additional credits can be purchased anytime, have no expiry, and remain available until used.

## What are Query Credits?

Query Credits are monthly compute limits designed to prevent runaway usage and keep DataStore plans affordable without compromising performance or reliability.

They are **not a day-to-day restriction**. In normal usage, you are very unlikely to reach your limit.

## Included Query Credits by Plan

| Plan             | Query Credits / month |

## How Query Credits are consumed

Query Credits are consumed when data is accessed or exported.

- **1 Query Credit ≈ up to 10 MB of data read or exported**
- Bulk operations are automatically optimized for efficiency
- Typical dashboards and exports consume very few credits

The limits are intentionally set much higher than normal usage patterns.

---

## Monthly reset & add-ons

- Included Query Credits reset automatically every month
- Unused monthly credits do not roll over
- **Purchased credits never expire** and remain available until used

---

## Where to view your usage

You can monitor Query Credit usage from:

- The **Homepage**
- The **Billing** section

In most cases, you won’t need to track this closely — the limits are designed to stay out of your way.

## In short

- Query Credits protect against accidental runaway workloads
- Normal usage stays well within limits
- No performance throttling
- Enterprise-grade infrastructure at predictable pricing
